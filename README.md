# AR_Flash_Card
## Problem Statement
  Education â€“ AR Flash Cards
## Tools Used
1. MindAR
2. Three.js
## How to use?
1.	Download the images from the images folder in the GitHub repository.
2.	Click on the link in the About section to see our project.
3.	Allow the web camera access to our website in the browser.
4.	Now show the test images (downloaded from the images folder) before the camera. You will see a 3D model for that target image.
5.	To get a better audio effect, use your earphones.
6.	When you move the image towards and away from the camera, you can see the model's size changing and sense the change in the sound volume for each model.
7.	You can also try to keep all 4 images together before the camera and see all the models simultaneously with their animations and sound effects.
